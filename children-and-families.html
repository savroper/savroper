    <h1>Amish</h1>
    <h2>Children and Families<h2>
      <p>Amish children typically attend one-room schools run by the community, and they attend school only through the eighth grade; this eighth-grade limit in the United States was deemed acceptable by a 1972 Supreme Court ruling. Instruction is in English and concentrates on the basics of reading, writing, and math. Amish history and practical farming and homemaking skills are also taught. As in many of the separatist branches of Protestantism, convincing the children of believers to stay in the faith community can often be a challenge. If a young man joins a Mennonite church or other less exacting religion, the Amish will often say “he got his hair cut.” If a young person abandons the faith altogether, they say that person “went English.”</p>
      <p>The quiet, reserved manner that the Amish try to maintain does not prevent them from partaking of common pastimes and games. Volleyball and softball are popular with many Amish families, but they are played strictly for enjoyment and not in a spirit of competition. Flower gardens, if kept simple, are also permissible. Once the daily chores are finished and the children’s schoolwork completed, Amish families will often read or sing together in the evenings, before going to bed early in preparation for their next day’s chores.</p>
